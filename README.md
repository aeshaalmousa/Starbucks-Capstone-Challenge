### File Descriptions:

- data
    - portfolio.json: Offers sent during 30-day test period (10 offers x 6 fields)
    - profile.json: Rewards program users (17000 users x 5 fields)
    - transcript.json: Event log (306648 events x 4 fields)

- README.md

### Instructions:
If you are using the workspace, you will need to go to the terminal and run the command `conda update pandas` before reading in the files. This is because the version of pandas in the workspace cannot read in the transcript.json file correctly, but the newest version of pandas can.
